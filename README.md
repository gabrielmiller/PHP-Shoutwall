# PHP Shoutwall
## About
This is a project for me to learn how to connect PHP with a database and create an interactive web application. I made a point of condensing everything into a single file, so it's by no means as modular as it could be.
## Technologies
This project uses PHP with the mysqli database connector, MySQL, and some CSS.
